# **S**imple **A**I **P**rojects
SAP stands for **S**imple **A**I **P**rojects, which is this collection of games with simple AI algorithms for bots.
These games will use Raylib, with a central UI library so that they are all consistent with a consistent colour scheme.

## SAP-GameAI
| Game           | Algorithm | Code Name | Link                                      |
| :------------- | :-------- | :-------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| Dots And Boxes |           |           | [Dots And Boxes](/dotsandboxes/README.md) |

Planned:
- Add in previous games (nacbot, bsbot, etc)

## Naming Scheme
SAP algorithms must follow a naming scheme, there are 2 versions, the identifyable "Algorithm", and the code name (which can be like a cooler name for it).
The name of the directory is just the game, if there are variants for it, the name can be changed later.

### SAP-GameAI

| Level | Code | Definition                 |
| :---- | :--- | :------------------------- |
| 0     | `L0` | Random based, basic        |
| 1     | `L1` | Simple, and rule based     |
| 2     | `L2` | Reactive, a little smarter |
| 3     | `L3` | Predictive, smart          |
| 4     | `L4` | Adaptive, intelligent      |
| 5     | `L5` | Strategic, best of all     |
